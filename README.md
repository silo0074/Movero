# Movero

**Movero** is a high-performance, asynchronous file copying and moving utility for Linux, built with Qt. It is designed to bridge the gap between simple file managers and low-level system performance, offering features like `O_DIRECT` support, grouped disk flushing, and hardware-verified checksums.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Hybrid Sync Strategy:** Balances data integrity and speed by batch-flushing data to disk (64MB default) to minimize I/O wait times.
- **Hardware Verification:** Optionally bypasses the Linux Page Cache using `posix_fadvise` and `O_DIRECT` to ensure files are read directly from physical storage during checksum verification.

## 🛠 Advanced Technical Implementation

It implements several low-level Linux kernel optimizations:

* **Memory Alignment:** Uses `std::aligned_alloc` with 4096-byte boundaries to support `O_DIRECT` I/O.
* **Zero-Cache Verification:** Implements the `fdatasync` + `POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED` sequence to guarantee that verification hashes are calculated from the platter/NAND, not RAM.
* **D-Bus Integration:** Communicates with `org.freedesktop.FileManager1` to highlight completed transfers in your native file manager.
